INLINE FUNCTION:
                .Inline function is a function, that is expanded inline when it is called.
                .When inline function is called whole code of inline function gets inserted at the point of inline function call.
RULES:
1. single instruction(morethan 1 line in inline function is there,then it is treated as normal function).
2.It doesn't contain looping statements & switch statement and goto.
3.It doesn't use recursive function.
4.Doesn't support static variables.


Advantages:
  .Fast execution
  .If you do any changes after execution of prgm ,then again you should compile because the code coming at calling function.






#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
inline int add(int a,int b)
{
    return a+b;
}

int main() {
    int x=2,y=4;
    cout<<"Sum of two numbers using inline function is: "<<add(x,y)<<endl;
    return 0;
}
